        <h2>Shane Tinsley: An Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Shane Tinsley, and I reside in Anaheim, California, where I work for Mickey Mouse at
            the world-famous Disneyland theme park. I am a Guest Relations Cast Member for Disney, making magic for
            people worldwide. Over the past few decades, I have worked for several organizations, ranging from small
            local businesses, like the Caverns of Sonora in Texas, to mega-corporations like Darden Restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a twenty-year hiatus from my first collegiate experience at Hendrix College in Arkansas, I recently
            returned to school. I have finished my organizational communications minor, and I am now working on my
            Software Development major. I believe that learning is a life-long journey, and I have been informally
            educating myself for many years. Serendipitously, Disney offers all employees the opportunity to return to
            school to obtain certifications, a bachelor’s degree, and a master’s degree, so I jumped at the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my youth, I struggled with my education due to undiagnosed mental and physical roadblocks. As an adult, I
            have found that I love educating myself, even though it can be extremely challenging. I am fortunate to live
            in a technologically advanced culture where I can utilize and harness the power of digital applications to
            aid in overcoming my learning challenges. Applications like Microsoft Word help me communicate in a way that
            would have been impossible only 40 years ago. Without the help of word processors and screen readers, I
            would be illiterate, and my writing would be incomprehensible. In the future, I hope to develop software
            that helps people overcome similar challenges.
        </p>

            <span class="sentence"> I have never coded in HTML but I have developed technology-centered systems and
                procedures for many organizations. </span> As a result, multitudes of my colleagues throughout my life
            have encouraged me to return to school for software development, leading me to this moment.
